          A functional trait is a morphological, biochemical, physiological, structural, phenological
          or behavioral characteristic that influences performance or fitness.Grouping species by 
          functional characteristics is a long-standing idea, but there has more recently been rapid
          development in the aplication of trait-based approaches to diverse topic in ecology.
